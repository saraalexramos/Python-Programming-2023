# Python Programming Course from [MOOC ](https://programming-23.mooc.fi/)

Hello, welcome!

In this repository you can find all the exercises I did for MOOC Python Programming 2023.

I hope it will help someone to find a different result or even to find a better "way of thinking".

Please note that I'm new to Python, and I'm just doing it for fun.

You can talk to me and ask me anything about the exercises.

Enjoy!
